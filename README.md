# GitHub Repositories Search App

> This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
> Check the `LIVE` web app [here](https://github-webapp.vercel.app/) and give your feedback.

This app uses [GitHub API](https://api.github.com/en/rest/reference/search#search-repositories) to search through repositories based on input from the user. The results are rendered on a table.

## Getting Started

> Note: [PNPM](https://pnpm.io) was used when developing this web app.
> If you will be using any other package manager remember to `DELETE` the `pnpm-lock.yaml` file at the root directory.
